# Hasher

## Hasher Introduction

Hasher is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman used to generate hash values for files and/or folders.

## Hasher Features

Hasher can generate hash values for a single file or a folder of files, as seen below.

### Hasher Options

Hasher provides examiners with multiple options in the Tools -> Options menu.

Within these options, examiners can choose which hash algorithms Hasher should calculate, how many worker threads, the default save path, default file delimiter, and other settings.

These settings will be saved within a `Hasher.ini` settings file.

### Hasher Settings

Below is an example of `Hasher.ini`.

```
[General]
DefaultSavePath = 
AutoSaveResults = False
FileDelimiter = Tab
ClearResultsBetweenRuns = False
MAXThreads = 10
[Algorithms]
MD5 = True
SHA1b32 = True
SHA1b16 = False
MD4 = False
Tiger = False
Whirlpool = False
SHA-256 = False
SHA-512 = False
RipeMD-256 = False
eMule = False
CRC32 = False
[Theme]
Theme = Visual Studio 2013 Blue
```

### Exporting Hasher Results

Once files/folders have been hashed in Hasher, examiners can export the results to multiple formats.

Exporting to `.txt` will provide an output file named similarly to `2022-11-12-222212-HasherResults.txt`.

Below is an example of Hasher output.

```
File name	SHA1 base32	MD5
D:\ZimmermanTools\PECmd.exe	Z5AODWE3HRXUWLJMJBEMFVXGK7APOAQU	1AFED4AFCB86C8AC6BA2AA3C6160072A
```

### Quick Help

Below is the information located in Help -> Quick Help.

```
To use, select some files and/or folders and drag/drop them onto the main program window. Alternatively, use the File menu options to select files or a folder.

As files are hashed, you can sort, filter, search, etc. by interacting with the column headers: Left click to sort and right click for a context menu with many more options.

CTRL-C will copy the highlighted row to the clipboard. ALT-C will copy only the selected cell to the clipboard.

You can export the search via the File menu once hashing is complete.

You can set various options via the Options menu.
```
