# WxTCmd

## WxTCmd Introduction

WxTCmd is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman used to parse the Windows Timeline. Windows Timeline was added to Windows 10 with the 1804 (April 2018) feature update. 

The Windows Timeline can be found at the following location: `C:\Users\%User%\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\L.CFUser\ActivitiesCache.db`
