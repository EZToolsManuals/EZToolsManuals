# Registry Explorer

## Registry Explorer Introduction

Registry Explorer is a GUI based tool used to view the contents of offline Registry Hives. It can load multiple hives at once, search across all loaded hives using strings or regular expressions, exporting of data, and much more. 

### Why Another Registry Tool?

The need for Registry Explorer and RECmd came about out of writing a fully managed offline Registry hive parser in C#. Existing parsers did not offer the features I was looking for and as such, research and coding began. The Registry project serves as the basis for several programs including ShellBags Explorer, AppCompatParser, etc. Once the back end was mature, I wanted an easy to use and powerful way to expose the capabilities of the parser.

Registry Explorer fills the gaps in existing tools and expands the capabilities of Registry viewers in many unique and powerful ways.  It is GUI based and contains powerful searching, filtering, and other visualization concepts that makes exploring Registry hives very easy while exposing all the technical information contained in Registry hives.

RECmd was created in order to be able to script access to Registry hives, conduct new research, and automate searching across multiple Registry hives at once from the command line.

Because both tools use the same back end, both have the same searching and viewing capabilities including the full recovery of deleted keys and values. The parser also exposes value slack.

In summary, the capabilities of Registry Explorer and RECmd allows for quickly examining multiple hives at once and they can be leveraged to find new places where currently understood data is located in an easy to use and systematic way. It can be used in educational settings to not only understand the Registry from a functional level, but also from a deeply technical perspective. 

### Getting Started

After starting Registry Explorer, the main interface is displayed.

Settings for various things like program options, window size, slider positions, window positions, recent searches, etc. are all saved and reloaded between program executions. You can reset these options by deleting the relevant files under the Settings directory in the main Registry Explorer folder. The `.layout` files are for the trees and grids. 

Tooltips are shown when hovering over different areas of the program. For example, hovering over the Key section of the status bar shows the following:

#### Interface sections

There are five sections to the main interface. 

##### Registry hives

On the left side of the window is the Registry hives tab. This tab displays the Registry hives that have been loaded and the keys contained therein. Once at least one hive is loaded and a key is selected, a context menu is available by right clicking on a key. The context menu options will be discussed below in the Key context menu section.

##### Available bookmarks

Next to the Registry hives tab is the Available bookmarks tab. This tab will be discussed in detail below.

##### Values

The Values grid shows all the values contained in the key that is selected in the Registry hives tab. Once a value is selected, a context menu is available by right clicking on a value. The context menu options will be discussed below.

##### Value details

The Value details area contains one or more tabs that dynamically adjust depending the type of value selected. In every case, a type viewer will be displayed that shows the value of the selected key. If a value has slack, a separate tab will be shown that allows you to view the slack space in a hex viewer. 
These concepts will be explained in more detail in the Using Registry Explorer section below.

##### Status bars

Across the bottom of the interface are several status bars as seen below.
