# EZViewer

## EZViewer Introduction

EZViewer is a standalone, zero dependency viewer for .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .log, .rtf, .otd, .htm, .html, .mht, .csv, and .pdf. Any non-supported files are shown in a hex editor (with data interpreter!). Please note, this tool is read only and therefore cannot edit any files!

EZViewer is a great tool to have on your flash drive when you’re on site at a search warrant or at a client’s site. There is no need to deal with Microsoft Office. Just use EZViewer in all of its fully portable glory so you can view those files without any of the first-party dependencies!
