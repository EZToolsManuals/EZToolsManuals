# XWFIM

XWFIM is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman that assists with installing and managing a local instance of [X-Ways](https://www.x-ways.net/). XWFIM allows examiners to download everything necessary to begin using X-Ways Forensics (including BYOD) or X-Ways Investigator in a few clicks. 

XWFIM also provides tooltips for X-Ways to leverage. These can be found by hovering the cursor over each option within X-Ways.

### Portable Installation

To create a portable installation of X-Ways using XWFIM, select the Tools -> Create portable installation feature. Please note, if you try to do this without having executed X-Ways successfully on the host system, a similar error message will likely display: `WinHex.cfg is missing from 'C:\xwf'. Open X-Ways at least once to create it and try again. Aborting...`

With a USB flash drive plugged in, one will see all attached USB flash drives available to create the portable installation on.
