# JumpList Explorer

## JumpList Explorer Introduction

JumpList Explorer is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman that can be used to visually parse JumpList files. JumpList files are [OLE containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/mfc/ole-background?view=msvc-170) like many other filetypes within the Windows operating system.
