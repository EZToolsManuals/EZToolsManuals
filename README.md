# This is the default new book content for writing a Leanpub book in plain text!

This repository contains some default content that can be added to a new Leanpub book so you can make your first book preview.

Just click "Use this template" on GitHub to create a new repo of your own, with everything set up just like it is here.

At the top level of the repo will be a "manuscript" folder.

In the "manuscript" folder, you will see a file called "Book.txt". The files listed in the "Book.txt" file are the ones that will be used to generate your book.

In this default content repo, the two files listed in "Book.txt" are the "chapter1.txt" and "chapter2.txt" files currently in the "manuscript" folder.

Also in the "manuscript" folder, you will see a "resources" folder. Images and other resources are to be placed in this folder.

If you're looking for a tutorial, please select the Getting Started walkthrough for your chosen book writing mode [here](http://help.leanpub.com/en/articles/3088382-quick-walkthroughs-for-getting-started-on-a-leanpub-book) in our [Help Center](http://help.leanpub.com/en), which has hundreds of useful articles for Leanpub authors.

Finally, [here is a link to the Markua manual,](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) which shows you everything you can do when you write a book in plain text on Leanpub.

Good luck!
